# Dropping Ruffus for now and going back to dispatchers.
# If decide to revisit Ruffus in the future, we can use this code as a reference - see main_ruffus.py for working (buggy) demo
# Look at matplotlib for better visualisations eg file flow through pipeline with folders as nodes etc - ruffus visuals suck
# Handle batch processing here
