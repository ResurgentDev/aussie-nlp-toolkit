## [0.3.0] â€“ 2025-04-23

### ðŸš€ Major Overhaul: Pipeline Expansion & Infrastructure Scaling

- Expanded the core data pipeline from **5 stages to 17**, covering every major aspect of modern LLM dataset engineering:
  - Added: **Preprocessing**, **Quality Filtering**, **Structuring & Metadata**, **Balancing**, **Human-in-the-Loop**, **Documentation & Auditing**
  - Newly introduced: **Data Versioning**, **Bias and Fairness Audits**, **Evaluation Feedback Loop**, **Compression & Archival**, **Configuration Profiles**, and **Red-Team Dataset Versioning & Reuse**
- Significantly restructured both `README.md` and `pipeline.md` to reflect these enhancements with clearer stages, better flow, and modular scaffolding for future growth.
- `README.md` now provides a simplified pipeline list and high-level directory overview with references to detailed docs.
- `pipeline.md` rewritten as a full technical specification with per-stage breakdowns, module placeholders, and output directories.

### ðŸ›  Refactors & Naming Alignment

- Renamed:
  - `cleaning/` â†’ `preprocessing/` (for consistency with stage name)
  - `data/cleaned/` â†’ `data/preprocessed/`
- Synced all stage names and directory paths across documentation and structure references.
- Introduced `configs/` directory for YAML/JSON-based pipeline profiles.
- Cleaned up `README.md` directory tree display to hide complex `data/` breakdowns, with links to detailed views.

### ðŸ§­ Architectural Planning

- Created placeholder `modules.md` to document individual modules with descriptions.
- Created `tests.md`, `testing.md`, `configs.md`, and moved of all detailed documents to `docs/` for better repo hygiene.
- Introduced breadcrumb-style links to help contributors find deeper documentation (e.g., `pipeline.md â†’ File Structure`).

## [0.2.0] - 2025-04-10
### Added
- `pipeline.md`: Detailed breakdown of the pipeline, moved from `README.md` for clarity and maintainability.
- `cleaning_dispatcher.py`: Manages file flow through the cleaning sub-pipeline.
- `tokenising_dispatcher.py`: Orchestrates the tokenisation sub-pipeline.
- `generation_dispatcher.py`: Handles output file type generation logic.
- `data/cleaned/cleaning/` and `data/processed/tokenising/` directories with `.gitkeep` files for sub-pipeline file management.
- Validation consolidated into `validate_pipeline.py` for streamlined checking and logging.
- `constants.py`: Centralized all file type constants for clarity and scalability.
- `data/loaded/` directory and `.gitkeep` file for managing temporary storage of loaded raw data.
- Initial `data_loader_dispatcher.py` module placeholder with docstring.
- Added pipeline overview and updated directory structure to the `README.md`.

### Changed
- `README.md`: Revised to include a concise pipeline overview and a link to `pipeline.md` for detailed documentation.
- Pipeline logic redefined:
  - Introduced dispatchers for Cleaning and Tokenisation stages to improve modularity and flow control.
  - Added comprehensive folder structure for managing intermediate pipeline outputs.
  - Adjusted validation logic to focus on a single `validate_pipeline.py` module.
- Revised `README.md` to remove redundant `raw/` subdirectories and clarify project structure.
- Updated `detect_filetype.py` with an improved docstring emphasizing its role in dynamic file classification.

### Removed
- `validate_input.py` and `validate_output.py` removed in favor of the consolidated `validate_pipeline.py`.
- Removed redundant validation step documentation in favor of streamlined logic.
- Deleted `data/raw/` subdirectories (`html/`, `pdfs/`, `csv/`, etc.) for simplification.
- Removed redundant raw subdirectory `.gitkeep` files.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-04-08
### Added
- Project initialization with directory structure and foundational modules.
- `data_loader_html.py` and `data_loader_json.py` modules (pending docstring finalization).
