## [0.2.0] - 2025-04-10
### Added
- `pipeline.md`: Detailed breakdown of the pipeline, moved from `README.md` for clarity and maintainability.
- `cleaning_dispatcher.py`: Manages file flow through the cleaning sub-pipeline.
- `tokenising_dispatcher.py`: Orchestrates the tokenisation sub-pipeline.
- `generation_dispatcher.py`: Handles output file type generation logic.
- `data/cleaned/cleaning/` and `data/processed/tokenising/` directories with `.gitkeep` files for sub-pipeline file management.
- Validation consolidated into `validate_pipeline.py` for streamlined checking and logging.
- `constants.py`: Centralized all file type constants for clarity and scalability.
- `data/loaded/` directory and `.gitkeep` file for managing temporary storage of loaded raw data.
- Initial `data_loader_dispatcher.py` module placeholder with docstring.
- Added pipeline overview and updated directory structure to the `README.md`.

### Changed
- `README.md`: Revised to include a concise pipeline overview and a link to `pipeline.md` for detailed documentation.
- Pipeline logic redefined:
  - Introduced dispatchers for Cleaning and Tokenisation stages to improve modularity and flow control.
  - Added comprehensive folder structure for managing intermediate pipeline outputs.
  - Adjusted validation logic to focus on a single `validate_pipeline.py` module.
- Revised `README.md` to remove redundant `raw/` subdirectories and clarify project structure.
- Updated `detect_filetype.py` with an improved docstring emphasizing its role in dynamic file classification.

### Removed
- `validate_input.py` and `validate_output.py` removed in favor of the consolidated `validate_pipeline.py`.
- Removed redundant validation step documentation in favor of streamlined logic.
- Deleted `data/raw/` subdirectories (`html/`, `pdfs/`, `csv/`, etc.) for simplification.
- Removed redundant raw subdirectory `.gitkeep` files.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-04-08
### Added
- Project initialization with directory structure and foundational modules.
- `data_loader_html.py` and `data_loader_json.py` modules (pending docstring finalization).
