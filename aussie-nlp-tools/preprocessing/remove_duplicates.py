Module: remove_duplicates.py

Purpose:
- Identifies and removes duplicate entries from cleaned text files to ensure unique and high-quality content for further processing in the Aussie NLP pipeline.

Frameworks/Tools:
- Utilizes hashing techniques such as `MinHash` or other algorithms for efficient duplicate detection.
- Optionally integrates with libraries like `pandas` for structured data handling.

Expected Inputs:
- File path to a cleaned text file in `data/cleaned/`.
  - Example: "data/cleaned/<original_filename>_cleaned.txt".

Expected Outputs:
- A deduplicated text file in `data/cleaned/`, containing only unique entries.
  - Example: "data/cleaned/<original_filename>_deduplicated.txt".
- Deletes the input file in `data/cleaned/` after successful deduplication.

Behavior:
- Detects duplicate lines, paragraphs, or other patterns using hashing techniques.
- Handles edge cases such as partial duplicates or ambiguous matches.
- Logs removed duplicates for transparency and auditing purposes.

Planned Test Approach:
- Test with text files containing:
  - Exact duplicates (e.g., repeated sentences or paragraphs).
  - Near duplicates (e.g., minor variations in repeated text).
  - Large files with hundreds or thousands of entries.
- Verify that the deduplicated file matches expected results with only unique content preserved.
- Confirm that the original cleaned file is deleted after processing.
