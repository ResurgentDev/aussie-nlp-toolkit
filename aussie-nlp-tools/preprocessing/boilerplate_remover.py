Module: boilerplate_remover.py

Purpose:
- Removes boilerplate text from cleaned files to ensure only meaningful and relevant content is retained for further processing in the Aussie NLP pipeline.

Frameworks/Tools:
- Implements custom logic and regex patterns to identify and remove boilerplate text.
- Optionally integrates with external libraries for predefined boilerplate patterns.

Expected Inputs:
- File path to a cleaned text file in `data/cleaned/`.
  - Example: "data/cleaned/<original_filename>_cleaned.txt".

Expected Outputs:
- A refined text file in `data/cleaned/`, where all boilerplate text has been removed.
  - Example: "data/cleaned/<original_filename>_boilerplate_removed.txt".
- Deletes the input file in `data/cleaned/` after successful removal.

Behavior:
- Detects and removes common boilerplate elements, such as:
  - Footer and header text (e.g., "Copyright 2025 Aussie NLP").
  - Navigation menus or disclaimers from web-scraped content.
  - Repeated or templated text found across documents.
- Logs skipped or ambiguous cases for manual review.

Planned Test Approach:
- Test with files containing varied boilerplate text, including:
  - Repeated headers and footers in multiple documents.
  - Common disclaimers and navigation menus from web pages.
  - Boilerplate text patterns embedded within paragraphs.
- Verify that relevant content is preserved and boilerplate is removed accurately.
- Confirm that the original cleaned file is deleted after processing.
