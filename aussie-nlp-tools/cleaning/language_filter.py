"""
Module: language_filter.py

Purpose:
- Filters text based on language, ensuring only content in the specified target language is processed further in the Aussie NLP pipeline.

Frameworks/Tools:
- Utilizes language detection libraries such as `langdetect` or `langid` for efficient identification.

Expected Inputs:
- File path to a cleaned text file in `data/cleaned/`.
  - Example: "data/cleaned/<original_filename>_cleaned.txt".

Expected Outputs:
- A language-specific text file in `data/cleaned/`, containing only content in the target language.
  - Example: "data/cleaned/<original_filename>_filtered.txt".
- Deletes the input file in `data/cleaned/` after successful filtering.

Behavior:
- Detects the language of each line or block of text within the file.
- Retains only content in the target language (e.g., Australian English).
- Logs excluded content and potential ambiguous language cases for review.

Planned Test Approach:
- Test with text files containing:
  - Monolingual content in the target language (e.g., all Australian English).
  - Mixed-language content (e.g., sentences in English, French, and Mandarin).
  - Edge cases, such as language ambiguity or unsupported languages.
- Verify that filtered output matches the expected language while retaining formatting and accuracy.
- Confirm that the original cleaned file is deleted after processing.
