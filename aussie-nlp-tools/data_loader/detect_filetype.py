"""
Module: detect_filetype.py

Purpose:
- Identifies the file type of a given dataset (e.g., HTML, JSON, CSV).

Frameworks/Tools:
- Built-in Python libraries (os, mimetypes).
- Optionally integrates with external libraries like `magic` for content-based detection.

Expected Inputs:
- Full file path as a string, including the filename.

Expected Outputs:
- Returns a file type constant from `constants.py`:
  - FILETYPE_HTML, FILETYPE_JSON, FILETYPE_CSV (for recognized file types).
  - FILETYPE_CORRUPT if the file contents do not match the expected structure.
  - FILETYPE_UNSUPPORTED for unrecognized file types.

Planned Test Approach:
- Verify detection of common file types using sample datasets.
- Test edge cases (e.g., unsupported or ambiguous file types).
