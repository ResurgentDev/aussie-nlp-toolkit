Module: detect_filetype.py

Purpose:
- Serves as the entry point for dynamically classifying raw files within the pipeline.
- Identifies the file type of a given dataset (e.g., HTML, JSON, CSV) based on its extension and content.
- Acts as a critical gatekeeper, ensuring only supported file types proceed further in the pipeline.

Frameworks/Tools:
- Built-in Python libraries (`os`, `mimetypes`) for file type detection.
- Optionally integrates with external libraries like `magic` for content-based detection to improve accuracy.

Expected Inputs:
- A full file path as a string, including the filename (e.g., "/path/to/my_file.html").
- Files should be placed in the `data/raw/` directory before calling this function.

Expected Outputs:
- Returns a file type constant from `constants.py` to classify the input:
  - `FILETYPE_HTML`, `FILETYPE_JSON`, `FILETYPE_CSV`, `FILETYPE_PDF`, `FILETYPE_TEXT`: For recognized and supported file types.
  - `FILETYPE_CORRUPT`: For files where the extension and contents do not match.
  - `FILETYPE_UNSUPPORTED`: For unrecognized file types.

Role in the Pipeline:
- This script processes all files in `data/raw/` to determine their type.
- Supported files are routed to the appropriate data loader module (e.g., `data_loader_html.py`).
- Unsupported or corrupted files are logged for error handling and are not processed further.

Planned Test Approach:
- Verify detection of all supported file types (`FILETYPE_HTML`, `FILETYPE_JSON`, etc.) using representative sample datasets.
- Test edge cases, such as:
  - Ambiguous or misleading file extensions (e.g., a `.html` file containing JSON).
  - Unsupported formats (e.g., `.docx` files when the loader does not handle them yet).
  - Corrupted files with mismatched extensions and content.
- Benchmark performance when processing a mix of small and large datasets.
