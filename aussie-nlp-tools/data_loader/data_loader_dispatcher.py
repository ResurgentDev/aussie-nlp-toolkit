"""
Module: data_loader_dispatcher.py

Purpose:
- Acts as the entry point for handling file loading operations within the Aussie NLP Toolkit.
- Routes files to the appropriate data loader module based on their detected file type.

Frameworks/Tools:
- Built-in Python libraries for basic file operations.
- Modules from `aussie-nlp-tools` for specific data loader implementations.

Expected Inputs:
- Full file path as a string, including the filename (e.g., "/path/to/my_file.csv").

Expected Outputs:
- Routes the file to the correct data loader module for processing.
- Logs errors for unsupported (FILETYPE_UNSUPPORTED) or corrupted (FILETYPE_CORRUPT) files, using `constants.py`.

Planned Test Approach:
- Test with various supported file types (e.g., FILETYPE_HTML, FILETYPE_JSON, FILETYPE_CSV) to ensure correct dispatch.
- Verify proper handling and logging of unsupported and corrupted files.
