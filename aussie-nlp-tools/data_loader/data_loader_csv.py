"""
Module: data_loader_csv.py

Purpose:
- Handles the loading and validation of CSV files, ensuring they are safely integrated into the Aussie NLP pipeline.
- Detects and resolves issues such as varying delimiters, encoding problems, or inconsistent structures.

Frameworks/Tools:
- Utilizes `pandas` for robust CSV reading and validation.

Expected Inputs:
- Full file path to a CSV file as a string, including the filename (e.g., "/path/to/my_file.csv").

Expected Outputs:
- Generates a temporary file in `data/loaded/` containing the structured data in CSV or JSON format.
- Naming convention: `<original_filename>_loaded.<extension>` (e.g., "my_file_loaded.csv" or "my_file_loaded.json").

Behavior:
- Detects and normalizes delimiters (e.g., commas, tabs, or semicolons).
- Handles encoding issues and ensures compatibility with UTF-8.
- Logs any structural inconsistencies (e.g., varying row lengths) for downstream processing.

Planned Test Approach:
- Test with CSV files of various formats, including:
  - Standard comma-delimited files with headers.
  - Files using alternate delimiters (e.g., tabs or semicolons).
  - Large CSVs with hundreds of thousands of rows.
- Verify that files are read correctly into the expected format with no data loss or corruption.
- Ensure robust error handling for malformed or unsupported files.
